## Intended use
Somalier is used to identify cases where the tumor and normal sample does not come from the same individual. 
This is done by comparing informative variants of the samples.
In a scenario where one of the samples in a tumor/normal analysis has been mistakenly swapped, this
tool can be used to identify this.
